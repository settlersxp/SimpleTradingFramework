# Syntax
- Always use onclick instead of on:click
- Always use onsubmit instead of on:submit. The correct syntax is onsubmit={function to call}

# Client side:
- Uses SvelteKit
- Uses Tailwind CSS
- When the code becomes too indented create new components in the same folder and use them.
- Reusable stores are in in /frontend/src/lib/stores
- Types are located into /frontend/src/lib/types
- Data fetching Vite endpoints are located in /frontend/src/routes/api
- Svelte5 code which requires authenticated users is in /frontend/src/routes/(authed)/
- Svelte5 code which requires anonymous users is in /frontend/src/routes/
- New node models are installed with "npm" and must be added in /frontend/package.json

# Design flow:
1. Create a frontend API if one doesn't exist yet
2. For every new component create a frontend Prop type if needed
3. Code using Svelte5 runes
4. Never use <slot></slot> because is deprecated. Always use {@render ...} when required to render a #snippet
5. Create the UI
